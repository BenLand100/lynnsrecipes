Always measure spices with your heart, but the amounts listed below are a good guideline. 

## Ingredients

- 1 lb dry pinto beans
- 6 cups chicken broth
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 1 tbs cumin
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 5 whole garlic cloves
- 1 tbs dried oregano
- 2 tbs butter (or bacon fat, optional)

### Tools
- Instapot
- Immersion blender


## Directions

1. Add everything to an Instapot except the butter/bacon fat and set to "beans" or manual for 35 min.
2.	Allow to natural pressure release for 45 min.
3. When the time is up, release the valve (it will likely still steam a bit) and drain the beans, saving the liquid.
4. Add the butter or bacon fat and blend with an immersion blender, adding liquid as necessary to help thin it out. About a cup of liquid is usually about right. If you add too much liquid, turn the pot onto sear/saute and cook some of the liquid out.
5. Taste to adjust the seasoning. Serve as is, or pour into a dish and top with cheese while still warm.

Always measure spices with your heart, but this is a good guideline--if you like it spicy, add more jalapenos and chili powder. This dip is a good way to use up leftover peppers in the fridge.

## Ingredients

- 6 ears of fresh corn or 4 cups frozen corn, thawed
- 1-2 Jalapenos, chopped
- 4 scallions, sliced thin 
- 1/2 c chopped cilantro 
- 2 cups Monterey/Colby Jack blend, divided 
- 8 oz (1 block) Cream Cheese, softened
- 4 oz Feta Cheese, crumbled
- 1/2 c Sour Cream 
- 1/4 c Mayo
- 1 tbs chili powder
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 6 cloves garlic
- Juice from 1 lime (about 2 tbs or so)




## Tools
- Big bowl
- Blender or hand mixer
- 9"x13" baking dish



## Directions

1.	Preheat the oven to 350 F. 

2. In a big bowl, combine the corn kernels, finely chopped jalapenos, most of the chopped scallions and cilantro (reserve some for garnish if desired), 1/2 cup of Monterey/Colby cheese, and the crumbled feta. 
 
2.	In a blender, or bowl with a hand mixer, place the cream cheese, 1 cup of Monterey/Colby cheese, mayo, sour cream, chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic and lime juice and blend for about 30 seconds until itâ€™s smooth. Pour it all over the corn mixture in the bowl and stir to combine. Pour it into a baking dish and top with the remaining 1/2 cup of Monterey/Colby cheese.
 
3.	Bake for about 20 min, until the top is golden brown and the dip is bubbly. Garnish with remaining scallions and cilantro.

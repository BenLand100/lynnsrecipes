Always measure spices with your heart, but the amounts listed below are a good guideline. 

## Ingredients

- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1/2 cup chicken stock
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 tbs butter, divided
- 2 tbs olive oil, divided
- 1 large shallot, finely diced
- 1 lemon – 1/2 juiced, 1/2 sliced into thin rings
- 5 garlic cloves, sliced thin
- 2 tbs grated parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (sauvignon blanc or pinot grigio)
- 1 tbs capers, drained
- Parsley, chopped for garnish
- Salt and pepper to taste


### Tools
- Large skillet
- Rolling pin or mallet to pound the chicken


## Directions

1.	Take your chicken breasts and cut them in half, lengthwise. Grab a mallet or rolling pin and pound them out until even 1/2-inch thickness and they’re tenderized. 
	- Note: cover with plastic wrap to keep flying chicken-shrapnel to a minimum.
2.	Pour all but about 1 tsp of flour into a plate or shallow dish. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken, then dredge in the flour.
3.	Heat 1 tbs each of olive oil and butter in a nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted and sizzly, put those chicken cutlets in and cook on both sides until nice and brown, about 4 min per side. Remove from pan.
4.	Reduce heat to medium. Add the rest of your oil to the pain and sauté the shallots and lemon slices until soft, about 3 min. Add the garlic and sauté another minute. Add wine and cook until reduced almost entirely, about 2 min. Add chicken stock and cook until reduced by half. Combine the remaining 1 tsp flour with 2 tsp water and set aside. Stir in flour/water mixture and cook for 1 minute, then parmesan and cook for 1 more minute.
5.	Remove the pan from heat, add lemon juice, 1 tbs butter and capers and stir to melt the butter. Add the chicken back to the pan, coat in the sauce, garnish with parsley, and serve.

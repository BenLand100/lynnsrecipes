Always measure spices with your heart, but the amounts listed below are a good guideline. 

## Ingredients

- 2 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 2 tbs vegetable oil
- 1 onion, halved and sliced thin
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/8 tsp cinnamon
- 1 (14.5 oz) can of fire roasted diced tomatoes
- 1/2 c chicken broth
- 4 tbs minced canned chipotle in adobo sauce, plus 2 tbs adobo sauce
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp grated lime zest, plus 2 tbs juice
- 2 tbs corn meal (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Taco fixings (tortillas, avocado, cotija, scallions, cilantro, lime wedges)



### Tools
- Instapot
- Blender


## Directions

1.	Pat dry chicken and season with salt and pepper. Turn instapot to sear and heat oil for a few minutes. Add the chicken and brown on both sides, about 3-4 min per side. Do this in batches to avoid crowding. Remove the chicken to a plate.
2.	Add remaining 1 tbs oil and cook onions about 5 min. Add spices, fry in the oil for about 1 min. Add tomatoes, broth, chipotle and sugar, bring to a boil and add the chicken back.
3.	Cook on manual for 30 min, allow to natural release for 15. When done, remove the chicken and shred. Take cooking liquid and blend until smooth. Return sauce and chicken to instapot to cook together until the sauce clings to the chicken. If the sauce does not thicken to your liking, add the corn meal.
4.	Stir in lime zest and juice and season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with any taco fixinâ€™s you like.

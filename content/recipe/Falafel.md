Always measure spices with your heart, but the amounts listed below are a good guideline. 

## Ingredients

- 1 lb dry chickpeas 
  - Note: do not use canned, you must start with dry beans
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 small onion, roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 6 cloves garlic
- 2 tbsp vital wheat gluten or flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp cumin
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 qt oil for frying (vegetable, canola, or peanut)

### Tools
- Food Processor
- Large bowl
- Baking sheet
- Deep frier setup (dutch oven or skillet with thermometer, etc)

## Directions

1. 24 hrs in advance, soak the chickpeas. Add the beans to a large bowl with 1/2 tsp baking soda. Drain the water and replace with new after 12 hrs. The chickpeas will double in size during this time.
2.	Add half the drained chickpeas to a food processor along with half the onion, parsley, garlic, flour, salt, cumin, coriander, pepper, cayenne and baking powder. 
3.	Pulse until the ingredients are well integrated and the consistency is somewhere between hummus and couscous. Scrape the bowl a few times to ensure good homogeneity. Pour into a bowl and repeat with the other half of the ingredients.
4.	Stir to combine the two batches, ensuring the mixture will stick together if pressed into a ball. Remove any large chunks that might remain. Cover and refrigerate for an hour.
5. Heat your chosen frying vessel and oil to about 360 degrees F. While the oil heats, shape your falafel.
6. Using a scoop or spoon, grab about 2 tbs of falafel mixture and roll into a ball between your hands or flatten into a patty and place on sheet tray. 
   - Note: if the falafel break apart completely, you can add some more flour to the mixture and try again. They will bind in the oil, so only add more flour if they're really falling apart.
7. Fry the balls for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until dark golden. Remove from the oil onto a paper towel to drain and sprinkle with salt before they're cool.
5. Serve in a pita or on Flatbread with Tzatziki, parsley, lettuce, onion, tomato and french fries, or on a salad.

Serves 6.

## Ingredients

- 1 package firm tofu
- i bunch kale
- 1 c unsweetened coconut flakes
- 1/2 c nutritional yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tbs oil
- 6 oz dried soba noodles
- 1/4 of a head of cabbage, sliced thin
- 1 red bell pepper
- 2 carrots
- 1/2 bunch of scallions, sliced thin lengthwise

### For the Dressing
- 1/2 c neutral oil
- 3 tbs tahini
- 2 tbs miso paste
- 2 tbs soy sauce
- 2 tbs honey
- 1 tbs toasted sesame oil
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/4 c lime juice (about 2 limes)
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 1/2 to 1 c water



## Tools
- Large bowl
- Large pot
- Blender
- 2 large baking sheets


## Directions

1. Press the tofu by wrapping it in a clean towel and placing it under something heavy (or use a tofu press). While it presses, continue on with the rest of the dish.
2. Set oven to 375 F. Tear the kale into 2" pieces and add in the bowl along with the coconut, nutritional yeast, salt and 2 tbs of oil. Toss to coat everything evenly with the oil and salt, then divide between two lined baking sheets. Bake for 30 min, or until the coconut is golden brown and the kale is crispy, rotating the sheets halfway through. When it's done, remove from the oven and let cool.
2. Meanwhile, set a pot of water on to boil for the noodles. Cook according to package directions then drain and rinse under cool water to stop the cooking. Add to the bowl you used for the kale mixture.
3. While the water is boiling, thinly slice the red pepper, cabbage and scallions, peel the carrot into ribbons with a veggie peeler, and add everything to the bowl with the noodles. Add half the toasted kale and coconut to the same bowl.
4. Make the dressing by combining the  tahini, soy sauce, miso, honey, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, lime juice, garlic and 1/2 cup of oil in the blender. Blend until it lightens in color and is very creamy, about 30 seconds. It will be very thick and might stop blending. Pour in half a cup of water to loosen it, check the consistency and add more until it's the consistency you like. Pour about half over the noodles and veggies. Toss everything together to combine. If desired, let chill in the fridge until the tofu is ready (noodles can be served warm, room temp or chilled).
5. Cut the tofu into bite-sized pieces, toss with seasoning as you like, and put back onto the baking sheet that had the kale on it. Bake at 375 until the tofu is lightly brown and crispy on the edges, about 15 min.
6. Put the saucy noodle mixture in bowls, top with some tofu and garnish with the toasted kale mixture. Serve along with extra dressing for drizzling.

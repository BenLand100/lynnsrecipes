# Lynn's Recipes

Anything can go on the home page, just include it in this file (`content/_index.md`).
The layout template `layouts/_default/list.html` contains special rules for rendering the home page, but primarily generates lists of pages, like the one shown after this content.
The items in the navbar (top) and other metadata that applies to the whole site are set in the `config.toml` file.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup AP flour
- ¼ tsp baking soda
- ¼ tsp cream of tartar
- ½ tsp cornstarch
- ¼ tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- ½ c buttermilk
- 4 tbs butter
- Optional additions: 1 thinly sliced scallion, 1 tbs of chives and ¼ c shredded cheddar; or 1 tsp cinnamon and ¼ c raisins. 




## Tools
- Mixing bowl
- Microwave safe bowl
- Baking sheet


## Directions

1. Set the oven to 425 F.
2. Place the buttermilk in the freezer to chill while you get the other ingredients all ready. Melt the butter in the microwave in a bowl, about 30-60 seconds depending on your microwave. Stir together dry ingredients in a medium bowl. If using any additions, add to the dry ingredients.
3. After the butter has cooled slightly, pour the buttermilk into the bowl with the butter and stir gently with a fork. You’ll get globs of butter that will distribute nicely in the batter. Pour the wet into the dry and mix until just combined. 
4. Divide the batter into 4 rough circles, and press gently on the top if desired for a uniform shape. Pop it in the oven and bake for 15 min. After 15 min, rotate your baking sheet and bake for another 10, or until golden brown on top.

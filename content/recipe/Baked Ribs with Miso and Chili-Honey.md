## Ingredients

### For the Ribs
- 1-2 racks Ribs
- 1/4 c miso (red, yellow or white)

### For the Glaze
- 1/4 c neutral oil 
- 2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 3 garlic cloves, finely minced
- 1 2‚Äù piece ginger, peeled and finely minced
- 1/3 c gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
- 1/4 c low sodium soy sauce
- 1/4 c rice vinegar
- 1/3 c honey


## Tools
- Foil
- Baking Sheet
- Large skillet
- Blender



## Directions

1.	Preheat oven to 300 F. Pat ribs dry and rub all over with miso paste. Wrap each rib rack in a double layer of foil. Bake until meat is tender but not falling off the bone 2 - 2 1/2 hrs.
2.	While the ribs bake, make the BBQ sauce. Heat oil and pepper flakes over medium low until the pepper flakes darken in color slightly, about 5 min. Add onion and salt, stir and cook on low until translucent. Then add garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant. Add gochujang, soy sauce and vinegar and cook until thickened slightly, about 5 min. Remove pan from heat and stir in honey.
3.	Allow mixture to cool, then blend until thick and glossy.
4.	Remove ribs from packages and wipe off miso paste with a paper towel. Heat broiler and finish ribs under broil, painting on BBQ sauce until the sauce is caramelized and the ribs are bubbling but not burned.
	* Note: Any extra BBQ sauce can be stored in the fridge for a month.

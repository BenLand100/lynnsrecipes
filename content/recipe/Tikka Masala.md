Always measure spices with your heart, but this is a good guideline. Use any protein you like--chicken, paneer, chickpeas, etc.

## Ingredients

### Protein marinade:

- 1 block paneer (about 550 g), cubed 
  - or 2 chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces 
  - or 2 cans drained chickpeas
- 1 c Greek yogurt
- 1 tbs garlic, minced
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 bell pepper, cubed
- 1 white onion, cubed

### Sauce

- 30 cashews
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 1 (28 oz) can tomatoes, or 2 large fresh 
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tbs paprika
- 1 tbs garam masala
- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbs garlic, minced
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- 3 tbs sugar
- 1 tsp powdered fenugreek (optional)
- ½ c heavy cream
- 3 tbs ghee 
- cilantro and scallions to garnish

### Tools
- Blender
- Large Pot or dutch oven
- 1 big bowl for marinading the protein 
- 1 medium bowl for soaking the cashews

## Directions

1.	Soak cashews as far in advance as you have. (Tip: ideally, this is overnight. If not possible, pour boiling water over and let soak for 15 min)
2.	Marinade your protein in the ingredients listed. A few hours in advance is ideal, but even while you assemble everything else still helps.
3.	In a large pot on medium-high heat, fry chopped onion in 1 tbs ghee until translucent. 
4.	Add ginger and garlic and fry until fragrant. 
5.	Add all the spices except fenugreek and sugar, fry until fragrant.
6.	If using canned tomatoes, add to a blender along with onions/garlic/spices and soaked and drained cashews. If using fresh, add the tomatoes to the mixture and cook until mushy, then blend with soaked and drained cashews.
7.	Blend mixture with ½-1 cup of water until very silky.
8.	Add remaining ghee to the pot and dump the marinaded protein in. If using chicken, fry in batches until partially cooked. If using paneer or chickpeas, fry in the ghee for a few minutes to cook out the raw spice flavor.
9.	Add tomato/onion/spice puree to the pot. Stir and let it come to a simmer then add the sugar and fenugreek. Adjust salt/sugar to taste.
10. Let it simmer for at least 30 min, but up to two hours, stirring occasionally.
10.	Add the cream just before you're ready to eat. Serve with rice or naan and top with cilantro and scallions.

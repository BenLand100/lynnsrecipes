Serves 4. Takes about 45 min.

Any leftover sauce is maybe the best salad dressing ever.

## Ingredients

- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 tbs canola oil
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1/3 c honey
- 1/4 c chicken broth
- 1 tbs apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbs balsamic vinegar
- 2 tbs soy sauce
- 1 tbs fresh thyme leaves



## Tools
- Oven-safe skillet
- Wooden spoon


## Directions

1.	Preheat the oven to 400 F. 

2. Pat the chicken dry then season on both sides with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Set your skillet on high. Add oil to the pan, swirl to coat. When it shimmers, add your chicken. Let brown for 4-5 minutes, flip and then place the skillet in the oven. Cook for 20 minutes.
3.	While the chicken is in the oven, whisk together the honey, broth, vinegars, soy and thyme leaves, if using. Crush and roughly chop your garlic.
4.	After the 20 minutes, remove the chicken from the oven and place the chicken on a plate. Return the pan to the stovetop on medium and add the garlic to the pan and fry for a minute. Pour in the sauce, which will bubble vigorously, and use a wooden spoon to scrape the fond off the bottom (about 1 min).
5.	Return the chicken to the pan to finish cooking in the sauce until the sauce has reduced by about half, 15-20 min. Periodically flip the chicken thighs in the sauce to make sure they get nice and coated.

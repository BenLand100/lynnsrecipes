## Ingredients

- 1 large sweet potato 
- 2 tbs cornstarch
- 2 tbs olive oil
- Dash of pepper, garlic powder, Aleppo/cayenne/paprika
- Parsley and salt for seasoning





## Tools
- Mixing bowl
- Parchment Paper
- Baking sheet


## Directions


1. Scrub clean and remove the rough parts of the potato skin. Slice about 1/8 inch thin (thickness of 2 quarters). Soak in an ice bath for 1 hr.
3. Set oven to 425 F and line a baking sheet with parchment. Drain slices and dry on a kitchen towel. Dry your soaking bowl, add slices back to the bowl and toss with cornstarch to coat. Start with one tbs then evaluate—you want a light coating. Once lightly coated, toss with oil and spices (not salt at this stage—it draws out moisture and will make them soggy). 
4. Lay slices on baking sheet so they don’t touch and pop the sheet into the oven. Cook 10-15 min, checking after 10. The variable here is how thick your slices are. If you made any too thin, you might want to take them out now, otherwise flip and return to oven to cook until browned, another 10-15 min.
